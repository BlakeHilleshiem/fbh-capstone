Note: I've been noticing that some of the parts of my program will occasionally not peform as intended. 
Issues being my while loops on my option functions being ignored
or partial input in my sql insert commands. I'm not sure if has to do with the size of the program or my computer's capacity to handle it. 
Just thought I'd mention if you come accross it.
